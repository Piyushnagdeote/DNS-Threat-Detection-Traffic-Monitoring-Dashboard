# DNS Threat Detection & Web Traffic Monitoring ‚Äì SOC Analyst Project

This repository contains a sample dataset (`web_traffic_logs_project.csv`) created for practicing SOC Level 1 skills, including threat detection, log analysis, and traffic monitoring.

## üìÑ Dataset Overview

- **Filename:** web_traffic_logs_project.csv  
- **Purpose:** To simulate DNS/web traffic logs for identifying suspicious activities such as domain abuse, IP anomalies, and potential IOCs.
- **Fields May Include:** Timestamp, Source IP, Destination IP, Domain Requested, Protocol, Action Taken, Threat Label, etc.

## üîß Tools & Technologies Used

- **Splunk:** For ingesting and analyzing log data via SPL queries  
- **VirusTotal:** For verifying suspicious domains or IPs  
- **Wireshark:** For packet-level traffic analysis (reference use)  
- **Excel/CSV:** For organizing and simulating log records

## üí° Use Case

This dataset can be used to:
- Practice detecting malicious DNS requests or domains
- Simulate alert triaging for SOC Level 1 scenarios
- Build SPL queries and visualize data in Splunk
- Demonstrate real-world use cases in a security analyst portfolio

## üéØ Ideal For

- SOC Analyst Interns and Freshers  
- Cybersecurity students preparing for interviews (e.g., Azen SOC Analyst L1)  
- Individuals learning log correlation and threat detection techniques

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is a synthetic dataset created for learning and demonstration purposes only. It does not contain any real-world or sensitive data.
